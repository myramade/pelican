Plan for Quick and Dirty Product Demo for Pelican
Here’s a revised version of your Product Demo Plan for Pelican — reframed to describe a working, interactive experience, not just a simulated one. The tone is grounded, direct, and investor-ready. It will focus on:
* Clarity of Value: Showing exactly how Pelican simplifies impact study management, delivers actionable insights, and supports collaboration.  
* Product Experience: Letting users click, explore, and engage with core flows — no smoke and mirrors.  
* Investor Fit: Polished visuals, intuitive design, and a clear story about how Pelican can scale.  
2. Demo Focus Areas
2.1. Core Workflow: From Intake to Insights
Persona: Program Lead or Analyst
We walk through a complete (yet streamlined) study lifecycle using real UI and clickable flows:
Start a New Impact Study
* Live Intake Form (pre-filled for demo):  
    * Program details (name, type, goals)  
    * Stakeholder identification  
    * File uploads, including baseline data  
* Generated Elements:  
    * Auto-generated surveys and interview templates  
    * Output: Live Data Mapping + Gap Analysis screen (this is the piece to build with logic)  
Note: This screen should show missing data fields, prompt for next steps, and visually signal progress gaps.
Track Study Progress
* Real Progress Tracker:  
    * Dynamic progress bar (% complete)  
    * Phase status (Intake → Data Collection → Reporting)  
    * Interactive task list showing who has submitted, what’s pending  
Generate Insights
* Live Dashboard:  
    * Executive summary (IRR, ROI, KPIs pulled from dummy backend)  
    * Heatmap visuals (qualitative + quantitative views)  
    * Strategy card outputs: Quick Wins, Long Bets, Needs Attention  
2.2. Collaboration Layer
* Live Comments Panel:  
    * Inline comments on specific data entries  
    * Alert system (e.g., “Jane added feedback on survey results”)  
    * Show how collaboration drives momentum  
2.3. User + Admin Management
* Working Admin View:  
    * Add/remove team members  
    * Assign user roles (Admin, Analyst, Viewer)  
    * Track permissions and compliance indicators
