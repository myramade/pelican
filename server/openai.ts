Follow these instructions when using this blueprint:
1. Note that the newest OpenAI model is "gpt-5", not "gpt-4o" or "gpt-4". gpt-5 was released August 7, 2025 after your knowledge cutoff. Always prefer using gpt-5 as it is the latest model. When copying code from this blueprint, ensure you also mention this information verbatim as a comment so that you don't revert it to older models: `// the newest OpenAI model is "gpt-5" which was released August 7, 2025. do not change this unless explicitly requested by the user`
2. Use the response_format: { type: "json_object" } option
3. Request output in JSON format in the prompt
